# Practice writing your first set of automated tests!
This repository is intended to help you write your first set of automated tests, using Scala, Selenium webdriver and Cucumber


#### About
I have written the very basics of the framework for you, now it's up to you to explore what can be achieved using selenium webdriver and software that you'll write yourself.

I'll give you a few tasks to complete to try and get your head around what's going on and what to do.

If you get stuck on anything, please don't hesitate to ask anyone on the payments team for pointers or help, or explanations on anything that isn't quite clear.

Here are a few useful links that might help you out; remember google can be your best friend in software development :)

#### Exercises
Start by trying to understand what everything is, in particular, the pages, runners, features and step definitions.

Next try filling in your own automated steps - play around, explore different available methods etc.

##### Try out automating some of the payments journey
If you want to try this one out, ask me and I'll provide the setup necessary to get you started on completing an end to end journey through one of in house developed card payment journeys.
